# HTTP CLIENT
HTTP is a sessionless client-server protocol in which the client initiates a request to the server and the server responds to the client.

HTTP is an application layer protocol and serves as the foundation for communication over the web. It uses TCP as its underlying transport layer protocol.

An *HTTP Request* is a message sent from a client to a web server that asks the server to respond with a specific resource. The request consists of a *method*, *target resource*, *headers* and a *body*. The method tells the server what you want it to do with the target resource.

*Request headers* contain metadata about the content of the request you are sending. The *request body* is the payload of the request.
